This is a simple reading helper. Just made it to get a basic understanding of a website and how to run it. I also wanted to learn how to interact with the DOM and use that to my advantage. It's quite ugly, thankfully I never said I was much of a designer. My first full project. All you need to do is input the book name and how many chapters that book has and you should be good to go. Seems self explanatory. The notes page is for notes on the book you're reading, if you want to remember something.
